//In this lesson FCC want you to Modify Array Data With Indexes!

/*
Unlike strings, the entries of arrays are mutable and can be changed freely.

Example

var ourArray = [50,40,30];
ourArray[0] = 15; // equals [15,40,30]
Note
There shouldn't be any spaces between the array name and the square brackets, like array [0]. 
Although JavaScript is able to process this correctly, this may confuse other programmers reading your code.


Task:
Modify the data stored at index 0 of myArray to a value of 45.
*/

// Example
var ourArray = [18, 64, 99];
ourArray[1] = 45; // ourArray now equals [18,45,99].

// Setup
var myArray = [18, 64, 99];

// Only change code below this line.

myArray[0] = 45;
