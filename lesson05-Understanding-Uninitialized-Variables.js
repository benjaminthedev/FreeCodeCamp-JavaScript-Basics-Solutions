// In this lesson FreeCodeCamp want you to understand what Uninitialized Variables are.

/*

When JavaScript variables are declared, they have an initial value of undefined.
If you do a mathematical operation on an undefinedvariable your result will be NaNwhich means "Not a Number".
If you concatenate a string with an undefinedvariable, you will get a literal string of "undefined".

*/


// Initialize these three variables
var a = 5;
var b = 10;
var c = "I am a";
