// In this lesson FreeCodeCamp teaches you the importance of Case Sensitivity in JavaScript

/*

In JavaScript all variables and function names are case sensitive. This means that capitalization matters.

MYVARis not the same as MyVarnor myvar. It is possible to have multiple distinct variables with the same name but different casing. It is strongly recommended that for the sake of clarity, you do not use this language feature.

Best Practice
Write variable names in JavaScript in camelCase. In camelCase, multi-word variable names have the first word in lowercase and the first letter of each subsequent word is capitalized.
