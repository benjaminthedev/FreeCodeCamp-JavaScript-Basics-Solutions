//In this lesson fcc wants you to Store Multiple Values in one Variable using JavaScript Arrays

/*
With JavaScript arrayvariables, we can store several pieces of data in one place.

You start an array declaration with an opening square bracket, end it with a closing square bracket, and put a comma between each entry, like this:

var sandwich = ["peanut butter", "jelly", "bread"].

Task:



Modify the new array myArray so that it contains both a string and a number(in that order).


*/

// Example
var ourArray = ["John", 23];

// Only change code below this line.
var myArray = ["A String", 99];
