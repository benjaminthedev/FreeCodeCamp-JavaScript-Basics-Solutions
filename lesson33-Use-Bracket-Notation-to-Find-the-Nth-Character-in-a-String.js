//In this lesson FreeCodeCamp want you to use Use Bracket Notation to Find the Nth Character in a String

// Example
var firstName = "Ada";
var secondLetterOfFirstName = firstName[1];

// Setup
var lastName = "Lovelace";

// Only change code below this line.

//Remember this is a zero based index - which mean 0 1 2
var thirdLetterOfLastName = lastName[2];
