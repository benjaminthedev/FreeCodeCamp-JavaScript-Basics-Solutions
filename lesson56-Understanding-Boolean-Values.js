//Understanding Boolean Values

/*
Another data type is the Boolean. Booleansmay only be one of two values: true or false. They are basically little on-off switches, where trueis "on" and falseis "off." These two states are mutually exclusive.

Note
Booleanvalues are never written with quotes. The strings"true" and "false"are not Booleanand have no special meaning in JavaScript.


Modify the welcomeToBooleans function so that it returns true instead of false when the run button is clicked.

function welcomeToBooleans() {

    // Only change code below this line.

    return true; // Change this line

    // Only change code above this line.
