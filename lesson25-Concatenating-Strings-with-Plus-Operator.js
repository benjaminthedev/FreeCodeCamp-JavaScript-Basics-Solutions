//In this lesson FreeCodeCamp want you to learn about Concatenating Strings with Plus Operator

// Example
var ourStr = "I come first. " + "I come second.";

// Only change code below this line

//Don't forget the space after This is the start.
var myStr = "This is the start. " + "This is the end.";
