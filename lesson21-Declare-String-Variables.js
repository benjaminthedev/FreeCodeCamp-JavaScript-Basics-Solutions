//In this lesson FreeCodeCamp want you to Declare String Variables

/*
Previously we have used the code

var myName = "your name";

"your name"is called a string literal. It is a string because it is a series of zero or more characters enclosed in single or double quotes.


Task:

Create two new stringvariables: myFirstNameand myLastName and assign them the 
values of your first and last name, respectively.

*/


//Use your name ;)
var myFirstName = "Benjamin";
var myLastName = "TheDev";
